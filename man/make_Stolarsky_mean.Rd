\usage{
make_Stolarsky_mean(p)

Stolarsky_mean(x, y, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{The power for the mean.}

\item{x, y}{The numbers to calculate the mean of.}
}
\value{
A function with two parameters \verb{(x,y)} to calculate a Stolarsky mean, except for the following cases. For \code{p==-Inf} the \code{min} function is returned. For \code{p==-1} the \code{geometric_mean2} function is returned. For \code{p==0} the \code{logarithmic_mean} function is returned. For \code{p==1} the \code{identric_mean} function is returned. For \code{p==2} the \code{arithmetic_mean2} function is returned. For \code{p==Inf} the \code{max} function is returned.

A Stolarsky mean.
}
\description{
Create a Stolarsky mean function to apply to two numbers, using a function factory. For a power \code{p}, the Stolarsky mean interpolates between certain other means such as the geometric mean (\code{p==-1}) and the arithmetic mean (\code{p==2}) for two numbers.
}
\details{
For repeat use use associated factory function and apply it, rather than the single-function-call equivalent.
