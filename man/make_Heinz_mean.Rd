\usage{
make_Heinz_mean(p)

Heinz_mean(x, y, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{The power for the mean.}

\item{x, y}{The numbers to calculate the mean of.}
}
\value{
A function with parameters \verb{(x,y)} to calculate a Heinz mean, except for the following cases. For \code{p==0} the \code{arithmetic_mean2} function is returned. For \code{p==0.5} the \code{geometric_mean2} function is returned.

A Heinz mean.
}
\description{
Create a Heinz mean function to apply to two numbers, using a function factory. For a power \code{p}, the Heinz mean interpolates between the arithmetic (\code{p==0}) and geometric means (\code{p==0.5}) for two numbers.
}
\details{
For repeat use use associated factory function and apply it, rather than the single-function-call equivalent.

\examples{
hm <- make_Heinz_mean(0.25)
hm(1,2)

Heinz_mean(1,2,0.25)
